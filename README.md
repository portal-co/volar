# volar

## Description
"VOLE-in-the-head computations for a cloud world". Cryptographic library implementing VOLE (Vector Oblivious Linear Evaluation) or related primitives.

## Goals
- [ ] Implement VOLE primitives
- [ ] Support secure computation

## Progress
- [x] Workspace setup with spec and primitives
- [x] Basic commit-open workflow
- [x] Basic operations on commitments
- [x] The Hypercube technique for seperate commitments from one commitment
- [x] Construction of commitments from consttants
- [ ] Construction of commitments from a witness or secret data
- [ ] Consistency checks to augment or replace the Hypercube technique
- [ ] IR proving (only one round)
- [ ] WAFFLE to VAFFLE
- [ ] VAFFLE to Volar IR
- [ ] Volar IR movfuscation
- [ ] IR proving (many rounds)
- [ ] Succinct proofs
- [ ] Support MPC
- [ ] Support nested proving/verification
