# IR

WAFFLE
v (lowering to VOLE-compatible ops)
VAFFLE (optimizations, inlineing, etc.)
v (removing function calls and replacing with dynamic block jumps)
Volar IR (constant folding, SSA opts)
v (replacing blocks with real-vs-fake flags)
Movfuscated Volar IR (more constant folding and SSA ops)
v (convert to ZK proof scheme) v (booleanize)
Proof                          Boolar IR (peephole)
